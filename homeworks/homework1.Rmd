**TH-1:** Linear regression slides, slide 20: fit the same model with the function `bayesglm()` of the `arm` package and comment. Then, use an informative prior and comment the results.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(arm)

bayesglm(dist ~ speed, data=cars)
```

**BDA-1:** Ex 2.7 (p. 58) - Noninformative prior densities.

(a) For the binomial likelihood, $y ∼ Bin(n, θ)$, show that $p(θ) ∝ θ ^{−1} (1 − θ)^{−1}$ is the uniform prior distribution for the natural parameter of the exponential family.
(b) Show that if $y = 0$ or $n$, the resulting posterior distribution is improper.

```{r}

```

**BDA-2:** Ex 2.8 (p. 58) - Normal distribution with unknown mean.

```{r}

```

**LAB-1:** Repeat the lab session using the dataset ShipAccidents in the AER package.

```{r}

```
