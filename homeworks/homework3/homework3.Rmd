## Exercise 1

**TH-1:** Probit model - Start from the logistic model on slide 20 `1992polls.stan` and write the probit specification of the model using the  `target+=` sintax in the model block and the `bernoulli_lpmf` function (for any doubt, see the Stan manual documentation in the Stan website). Simulate 1000 draws using the `1992polls` data and compare the results with the ones obtained using the `rstanarm::stan_glm` function.

## Exercise 2

**LAB-1:** Using the most appropriate graphical tools of the `bayesplot` package, analyze the models fitted during the 4th and 5th lab sessions on the cockroaches dataset and comment.
